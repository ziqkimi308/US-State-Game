# U.S. States Guessing Game

- The U.S. States Guessing Game is an interactive Python game built using Turtle graphics and Pandas. It challenges players to guess all 50 U.S. states and marks them on a map. Players can type the name of the state, and if correct, it will appear on the map. The game saves any states that were not guessed, allowing the player to continue later.

### Features:

- **Interactive Map**: As players guess each U.S. state, it gets marked on a map using Turtle graphics.
- **Progress Tracking**: Displays the number of correct guesses, updating dynamically.
- **Save Your Progress**: Missed states are saved to a CSV file, allowing you to continue where you left off.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: A simple input prompt where users can enter their guesses and a way to exit the game at any time by typing "Exit".

### How It Works:

1. **Start the Game**: Run the Python script and the game will present an interactive map of the U.S. states.
2. **Make Guesses**: Type the name of a state in the input prompt to guess.
3. **Correct Guess**: If the guess is correct, the state's name will appear on the map at the corresponding coordinates.
4. **Exit**: Type "Exit" to stop the game and save any missed states into a CSV file.
